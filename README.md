## User Stories


TinyApp is solving some basic problems a regular user to twitter might face.

	I want to be able to shorten links 
	so that I can fit more non-link text in my tweets.

	-As a twitter reader, 
	I want to be able to visit sites via shortened links, 
	so that I can read interesting content.

	-As an avid twitter poster, 
	I want to be able to see how many times my subscribers visit my links 
	so that I can learn what content they like.
